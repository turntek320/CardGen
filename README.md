# Credit Card Generator (CardGen)

A credit card generator for fake verification is a tool used to create fake credit card numbers that mimic the format of real credit card numbers. \
These numbers are typically used for testing purposes, such as verifying the functionality of e-commerce websites or software applications that require credit card input without involving real financial transactions.

2. Variety of Card Types: The tool can generate numbers for different card types such as Visa, MasterCard, American Express, etc.
3. Expiration Dates: Often includes the ability to generate corresponding expiration dates and CVV numbers.

# About the program
A currently free program for generating credit cards. \
In addition, the card generation by the program is not completely random. Data for generating a card is taken from private and public databases that, so to speak, generate cards. \
Therefore, there is a chance to get data from a real person’s card with the balance on it. I tested manually, calculated the probability of this event, approximately 1 out of 100 generated cards had a balance (from $3 to $2400), but I did not touch the money. \
But if you are a pro and know what to do, then I will be happy to receive a percentage of your profits, the wallet addresses are listed below.
